- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches for isolated changes
- `upstream/master` - Tracks official Metabase repository

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:goat-io/metabase.git
cd metabase

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/metabase/metabase.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Creating New Features
```bash
# Create feature branch from upstream
git checkout -b feature/my-feature upstream/master

# Make changes...

# Commit with descriptive prefix
git commit -m "[CUSTOM] feat: My new feature"  # For GOAT-specific features
git commit -m "[UPSTREAM] fix: Bug fix"        # For potential upstream contributions
```

### Updating from Upstream
```bash
# Fetch latest upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Update feature branches
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase upstream/master

# Update master
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

## Building and Running

Follow the standard [Metabase development guide](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/master/docs/developers-guide/start.md).

### Quick Start

### Running with Custom Features
All custom features are enabled by default when running from the master branch.

## Testing

### Stored Procedures
1. Create procedures in your PostgreSQL database
2. Sync the database in Admin â†’ Databases
3. Check autocomplete in SQL editor

### Action ResultSet
1. Create an action that executes a SELECT or function

### Success Message Templates
1. Create an action with a success message containing `{{variables}}`
2. Execute the action
3. Verify the interpolated message

## Contributing

### To This Fork
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes following Metabase coding standards
3. Test thoroughly
4. Create PR against our master branch

## Maintenance

### Keeping Features Updated
```bash
# Update all feature branches after upstream changes
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep 'origin/feature'); do
  git checkout ${branch#origin/}
  git rebase upstream/master
done
